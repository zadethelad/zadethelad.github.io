# About me Website
This is an epic website that I made to flex on everyone else in my class

## Usage
> **YOU CAN'T USE THIS WITH `file://` URLS. I NEEDS TO BE SERVED OVER HTTP(S)**

- Install a web server (skip if you are fine with using python's built in one)
- Run the webserver in this directory. If you're using python's built in server, use on of the snippets below:
```bash
# Python 3.x+
$ py -m http.server 80
$ python -m http.server 80
$ python3 -m http.server 80
# Python 2.7-
$ py -m SimpleHTTPServer 80
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80
```
- Navigate to [`http://localhost`](http://localhost) in your browser
- Bask in the awsomeness of my site

## Random notes;
- [`about.css`](about.css) is [`about.source.css`](about.source.css) after it's been run through autoprefixer with this browserlist:
```browserlist
> 0.01%,
last 2 versions,
Firefox ESR
```
